# Key Stroke Logging Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how keyboard input events can be captured using Python.
It is developed strictly for educational and academic purposes.

## Technology Used
- Python
- pynput library

## Working
The program listens for keyboard key press events and stores the captured
keystrokes in a text file. Logging stops when the ESC key is pressed.

## Output
Keystrokes are saved in a file named `key_log.txt`.

## Ethical Note
This project is intended only for learning and cybersecurity awareness.
